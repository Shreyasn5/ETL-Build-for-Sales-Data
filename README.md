# ETL-Build-for-Sales-Data
# This project demonstrates how to build a data pipeline that ingests sales data from an API, stores it in Amazon Redshift, and schedules the pipeline using Apache Airflow and Control-M. The project will include the following components:

#Data Ingestion:

Ingest sales data from a mock API.
Use Control-M for scheduling and managing the ingestion process.
Data Transformation:

#Transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis.
Use Apache Airflow for orchestrating the data transformation process.

#Data Storage:

#Store the transformed data in Amazon Redshift.
Scheduling and Monitoring:

Use Control-M for managing and monitoring the entire ETL process.
Integrate Airflow with Control-M for enhanced scheduling and workflow management.
